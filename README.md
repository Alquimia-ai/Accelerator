# Alquimia AI Accelerator

Welcome to the **Alquimia AI Accelerator** repository! This "hands-on" repository is designed as a quick-start guide to help you understand and implement Alquimia AI capsules across various domains, including NLP, computer vision, and audio.

## Repository Structure

The accelerator is divided into three main sections, each containing a variety of ready-to-use implementations and examples in the following fields:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

   - NLP, or Natural Language Processing, is a branch of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves techniques and algorithms that allow machines to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
   - This section provides capsules that demonstrate NLP implementations, ranging from text processing and sentiment analysis to advanced language generation.
